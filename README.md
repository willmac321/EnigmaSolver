# EnigmaSolver


A brute force enigma solver that uses a dictionary attack to crack messages.

The program looks for an input as a text file and outputs matching cribs to an output file.

Working on the peg board implementation, right now only iterates through different Crib and rotor settings.

The original code and algorithms were developed during the Tech for Tyler Code-a-thon in November,2017.  This code lead me to a first place victory in the code cracking event :)# EnigmaCracker
